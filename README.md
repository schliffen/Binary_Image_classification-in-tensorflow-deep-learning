# Binary_Image_classification-in-tensorflow-deep-learning
in this repo I applied cnn and variational autoencoders to classify sushi and sandwich dataset in tensorflow
I do not provide data and trained frozen graph due to size limitation, but you can find sushi-sandwich dataset which I used here from amazone or elsewhere.
